Welcome to the **AI-Powered Web Scraper**, a powerful and efficient tool designed to extract structured data from websites with complex, dynamic content. This repository leverages the power of **Ollama**, **BrightData**, **Selenium**, and other cutting-edge technologies to create a scraper that handles websites that rely on JavaScript or other dynamic elements for rendering content. The solution is built to be flexible and easily customizable to suit various use cases, such as data analysis, research, competitive monitoring, and more.

## Features

- **AI Integration**: Leverage artificial intelligence for intelligent scraping and content analysis.
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Works seamlessly with JavaScript-rendered content using Selenium and BrightData.
- **Proxy Rotation**: Protects against IP bans with built-in proxy rotation for uninterrupted scraping.
- **Data Export**: Easily export scraped data into various formats like CSV, JSON, or databases.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify scraping rules and add new features according to your needs.
- **Efficiency**: Designed to scrape data without overloading websites, ensuring minimal impact on server resources.

## Installation

To get started with the **AI-Powered Web Scraper**, follow these steps to install the required dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CEORocks/ai-web-scraper.git
   cd ai-web-scraper
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables and configure your proxies (optional but recommended for large-scale scraping).

## Usage

Once the scraper is set up, you can start extracting data by running the scraper with the following command:

```bash
python scraper.py --url <target-website-url> --output <output-file>
```

### Example

```bash
python scraper.py --url https://example.com/products --output data/products.json
```

This command will start the scraping process for the target URL and save the extracted data in a JSON format. You can specify different formats like CSV depending on your needs.

## Customization

This scraper is highly customizable. To modify the behavior of the scraper, navigate to the `scraper.py` file and update the scraping logic, such as:

- Defining the CSS selectors or XPath expressions to locate elements.
- Configuring the delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the website.
- Adding your own proxy list or rotating proxies based on your requirements.
